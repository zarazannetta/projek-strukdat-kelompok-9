# Sistem Distribusi Barang Startup Frozen Food di Wilayah Jabodetabekjur
## Frozen Food Startup Goods Distribution System in the Jabodetabekjur Area

# Methods
## Queue
Queue or FIFO (First In First Out) is a data structure used for processing data in the order they were added. This is suitable for delivery systems to ensure orders are processed in the order they were received, preventing customer dissatisfaction due to long waiting times.

## Linked List
Linked List is a data structure used to store a sequence of elements. It allows for efficient addition, removal, and searching of data elements. Linked lists are suitable for managing sequential data, such as delivery orders or driver schedules.

## Graph
Graph is a data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges (links) used to represent connections between objects. Algorithms like Dijkstra are used to find the shortest path for delivery routes, ensuring efficient delivery.

# Results and Discussion
This project aims to design and implement a structured delivery management system using various data structures. Key features include:

1. Order Management: Orders are stored in a queue and processed in FIFO order.
3. Tracking: The system tracks the status and location of items during delivery.
4. Stock Management: Inventory is updated upon successful delivery.
5. Driver Scheduling and Route Management: Using Dijkstra's algorithm, the system schedules deliveries and determines the shortest delivery routes.
6. Customer Notifications: Customers receive notifications about the delivery status.
   
# Conclusion
A structured delivery program has been developed for frozen food startups in the Jabodetabekjur region. The system effectively manages deliveries using data structures like queues, graphs, and linked lists, and optimizes delivery routes with Dijkstra's algorithm. This enhances the efficiency of the distribution system and improves customer satisfaction.
